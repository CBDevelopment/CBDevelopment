### NeuroDash
#### Abstract

Neurotechnology standards help foster ethical developments by professionals in the field, but accessing them can be complicated. We, alongside Dr. Ricardo Chavarriaga of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, aimed to consolidate existing standards into a novel dashboard and updatable database where professionals can better access these resources. To develop the dashboard, we familiarized ourselves with how professionals interact with standards, curated documents for database inclusion, and constructed a working product. The dashboard streamlines the process of accessing standards. Future expansions should improve technical features, develop a document curation process, and build inter-organizational support for this impactful tool.
